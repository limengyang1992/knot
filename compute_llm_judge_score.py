Forget question: {forget_q}

Definition of dependency: Is understanding the core concept needed to answer the forget question also necessary to answer the retain question?

1 = No dependency (completely independent knowledge)
2 = Weak dependency (tangentially related)
3 = Moderate dependency (share some underlying concepts)
4 = Strong dependency (same core concept, different applications)
5 = Inseparable (cannot answer one without the other)
